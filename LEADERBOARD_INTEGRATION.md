## 🔧 How It Works

### **New User Detection Logic:**
```typescript
// In Home.tsx
const sevenDaysAgo = Date.now() - (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
const hasRecentEnrollment = confirmed.some((p: any) => {
  const createdAt = new Date(p.createdAt).getTime();
  return createdAt > sevenDaysAgo;
});
setIsNewUser(hasRecentEnrollment && confirmed.length <= 2);
```

### **Onboarding Persistence:**
```typescript
// Checks localStorage
const hasSeenOnboarding = localStorage.getItem('leaderboard_onboarding_seen');

// Saves when dismissed
localStorage.setItem('leaderboard_onboarding_seen', 'true');
```
